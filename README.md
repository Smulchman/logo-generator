## Description

This is a simple app executed through the console to create an svg file based on user input.

## Usage

You can view a video of the app in use [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vd5smYW1J1KigooxrPuAh-7NXtgpfEhW/view)\

To use this app, you need to download the repository to your local machine.\
After doing so, if you type 'node index' into your console while in the folder of this repo, you will be given a series of prompts.\
The prompts will ask for text content, a text color, a shape, and a shape color. The color prompts do not check to make sure that you have entered a valid color so the svg file will not function properly if you do not enter an appropriate color keyword or hexcode.\
After you have followed the prompts your svg file will be created in the same directory as the index.js file. Opening it using a browser will let you see what your logo looks like.\
